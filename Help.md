This interface translates naturalized commands to actions in the [VegaLite] data visualization language.
To use this tool, **type a command** like "remove ticks", "change x label to XYZ", "move the axis label down" and press enter.
Use *select an example* to try another example (from [VegaLite examples](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/examples/)).

If you are happy with the result, click **Use**, which then set that modification as the Current Example, and you can proceed with further modifications.
